# MesosticsMachine-2018

The .java files in this repository comprise a MesosticsMachine, a software system to aid in the implementation of a score by John Cage to create a musical realization of a literary work.  This is a nearly complete, fully refactored version of the system submitted as a final project for the degree of MSc in Software Development in Queen's University of Belfast in September 2017.  The focus of refactoruing has been to apply OOP design principles and patterns and more effective and concise coding practices. 

Further background documentation is held in the MesosticsMachine-Archive repository on this GitHub site.

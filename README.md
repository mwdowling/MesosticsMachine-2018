# MesosticsMachine-2018

The .java files in this repository comprise a MesosticsMachine, a software system to aid in the implementation of a score by John Cage to create a musical realization of a literary work.  This is a fully refactored version of the system submitted as a final project for the degree of MSc in Software Development in Queen's University of Belfast in September 2017, after applying OOP design principles and patterns. 

Further background documentation is held in the MesosticsMachine-Archive repository on this GitHub site.  

As of 12 February 2018, classes in the NextItem and the NextItemFiltered hierarchies are complete.  Classes dealing with sounds and finishing require further refactoring and testing. THe GUI is appropriately structured but each action needs to be tested.
